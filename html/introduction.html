		<p>BitTorrent is a free speech tool.</p>

		<p>BitTorrent gives you the same freedom to publish previously
		enjoyed by only a select few with special equipment and lots
		of money. ("Freedom of the press is limited to those who own
		one" -- journalist A.J. Liebling.)</p>

		<p>You have something terrific to publish -- a large music or
		video file, software, a game or anything else that many
		people would like to have. But the more popular your file
		becomes, the more you are punished by soaring bandwidth
		costs. If your file becomes phenomenally successful and a
		flash crowd of hundreds or thousands try to get it at once,
		your server simply crashes and no one gets it.</p>

		<p>There is a solution to this vicious cycle. BitTorrent, the
		result of over two years of intensive development, is a
		simple and free software product that addresses all of these
		problems.</p>

		<p>The key to scaleable and robust distribution is cooperation.
		With BitTorrent, those who get your file tap into their
		upload capacity to give the file to others at the same time.
		Those that provide the most to others get the best treatment
		in return. ("Give and ye shall receive!")</p>

		<p>Cooperative distribution can grow almost without limit,
		because each new participant brings not only demand, but
		also supply. Instead of a vicious cycle, popularity creates
		a virtuous circle. And because each new participant brings
		new resources to the distribution, you get limitless
		scalability for a nearly fixed cost.</p>

		<p>BitTorrent is not just a concept, but has an easy-to-use
		implementation capable of swarming downloads across
		unreliable networks. BitTorrent has been embraced by
		numerous publishers to distribute to millions of users.</p>

		<p>With BitTorrent free speech no longer has a high price.</p>
