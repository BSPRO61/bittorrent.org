With this extension, BitTorrent clients are able to discover caches
nearby on the network.  When a cache is present, the user benefits
from having a high capacity peer from which the user's client
downloads and to which it can delegate seeding.  When a cache inside
the user's Internet Service Provider (ISP) network seeds on behalf of
the client, it frees upstream capacity in the user's access network
benefiting the user and those that share the access network.  When
subsequent peers transfer from their ISP's cache, the ISP experiences
less transit traffic.


The Discovery Mechanism
=======================

To find the caches for its ISP, a BitTorrent client performs a reverse
DNS lookup on its host's IP address and then obtains the SRV resource
record associated with the host's domain name.  For example, a host with
IPv4 address w.x.y.z obtains the PTR record at

::
  z.y.x.w.in-addr.arpa

Assume the returned PTR record contains example.com.  The client then
looks up the SRV record at

:: 
  _bittorrent._tcp.example.com

The target field in the SRV resource record contains the domain name
of the cache and the port specifies the location on that cache where
the BitTorrent implementation listens.

The SRV resource record type is described in RFC 2782 [#RFC 2782]_.  Reverse DNS
lookups are described in RFC 1034 [#RFC 1034]_.


Network Address Translators
===========================

Many hosts on the Internet sit in private networks that connect to the
Internet via a Network Address Translator (NAT).  Such hosts may have
an IP address allocated from one of the three private IP address
ranges defined by IANA, i.e., 10.*.*.*, 172.*.*.*, or 192.*.*.*.  When
communicating with hosts outside the private network, the NAT
translates the private IP to an IP address that is globally routable.
This globally routable address is the host's *public IP address*.

When finding a cache, the BitTorrent client must use its host's public
IP address.  A BitTorrent client can obtain its host's public IP by
either querying the tracker and looking at the value to the returned
*external ip* key [#BEP 24]_ or from other peers using the *yourip*
extension defined for the *Extension Protocol* proposed in [#BEP 10]_.
