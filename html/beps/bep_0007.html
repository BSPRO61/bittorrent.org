<p>This extends the tracker protocol to support simple obfuscation of the
peers it returns, using the info hash as a shared secret between the
peer and the tracker. The obfuscation does not provide any security
against eavesdroppers that know the infohash of the torrent.  The goal
is to prevent internet service providers and other network
administrators from blocking or disrupting bittorrent traffic
connections that span between the receiver of a tracker response and
any peer IP-port appearing in that tracker response.</p>
<p>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are

<div class="section" id="announce-parameter">
<h1>announce parameter</h1>
<p>When using this extension, instead of passing the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">info_hash</span></tt> parameter
to the tracker, an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sha_ih</span></tt> is passed.</p>
<p>The value of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sha_ih</span></tt> MUST be the info-hash of the torrent, with a second
SHA-1 applied to it.</p>
<p>For example if a torrent has infohash with hex representation
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabedef3b482cd9aea9434d</span></tt> then its <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sha_ih</span></tt> is
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sha1(infohash)='6b4f89a54e2d27ecd7e8da5b4ab8fd9d1d8b119'</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The value MUST be url encoded, just like the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">info_hash</span></tt>.  Thus the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sha_ih</span></tt> above when url encoded becomes
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kO%89%A5N-%27%EC%D7%E8%DA%05%B4%AB%8F%D9%D1%D8%B1%19</span></tt>.</p>
<p>This extension does not change the semantics of any parameter passed
in the peer's announce.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="announce-response">
<h1>announce response</h1>
<p>If the tracker supports this extension, the response should be exactly the
same as if the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">info_hash</span></tt> was passed, except that any field that contains
peer information (such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peers</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">peers6</span></tt> or any other field defined
by another extension) MUST be obfuscated as described in the next section.</p>
<p>There are additional parameters the tracker may OPTIONALLY return.
These are discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="#optimizations">optimizations</a> section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="peer-list-obfuscation">
<h1>peer list obfuscation</h1>
<p>We distinguish between the <em>tracker peer list</em> and the <em>returned peer
list</em>.  The <em>tracker peer list</em> contains the ip-port pairs of all
peers that have reported to the tracker that they are downloading or
seeding a given file with a given infohash.  The tracker may store
this peer list however it wishes.  The <em>returned peer list</em> contains a
packed array of ip-port pairs conforming to the BitTorrent protocol
specification.  If the swarm is sufficiently large then the returned
ip-port pairs constitute a subset of the ip-port pairs in the
<em>tracker peer list</em>.</p>
<p>The returned peer list is encrypted using RC4-drop768 encryption using
the infohash as a shared secret and optionally an initialization
vector.</p>
<p>For the remainder of this document RC4 refers to RC4-drop768.  In the
process of encryption, RC4 generates a pseudorandom string that is
XOR'd with the plaintext to generate the ciphertext.  The receiver
recovers the plaintext by generating the same pseudorandom string and
XOR'ing it with the ciphertext.  In generating the pseudorandom
string, the tracker and client MUST discard the first 768 bytes.  All
indices into the pseudorandom string ignore the first 768 bytes, i.e.,
index 0 refers to the first undiscarded byte.</p>
<p>To communicate an initialization vector, the tracker includes in the
bencoded response the key <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">iv</span></tt> with value set to a byte string
containing the initialization vector.  The initialization vector can
be of arbitrary length and is sent in plaintext.</p>
<p>If the tracker sends no initialization vector then the first 64-bits
of the infohash are used as the RC4 key.  If the tracker provides an
initialization vector then the RC4 key is generated by appending the
vector to the infohash and then hashing with sha1.  The first 64 bits
of the resulting hash are then used as the RC4 key.</p>
<p>For example, given infohash <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabedef3b482cd9aea9434d</span></tt>
and initialization vector <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">abcd</span></tt> both represented in hex, the RC4 key
is derived as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
hash = sha1( 'aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabedef3b482cd9aea9434dabcd' )
key = hash[0:64]
</pre>
<p>where [i:j] denotes the ith through jth bit including the ith but
excluding the jth.  The resulting key in hex is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f36e9cae87cf33e0</span></tt>.</p>
<p>A 64-bit key is used to avoid U.S. export restrictions.</p>
<p>It is RECOMMENDED that the tracker use the initialization vector, and
that it change the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">iv</span></tt> on roughly the same period as the rerequest
interval.  The reasoning for this is contained in the rationale.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="optimizations">
<h1>optimizations</h1>
<p>The described optimizations are OPTIONAL for the tracker, but the
corresponding client-side MUST be implemented by those that support
this extension.  These extensions hobble the strength of the RC4
encryption in order to improve tracker performance.  In the <a class="reference internal" href="#rationale">rationale</a>
section we discuss why hobbling RC4 is reasonable and in many cases
has negligible foreseen effect on security.</p>
<p>For the purpose of these optimizations we assume that the tracker
stores the tracker peer list for each infohash as a packed array that
can be copied directly into the response.  We further assume that the
packed array is reused many times and that with each request the
tracker either returns the entire packed array or copies a single
contiguous substring from the tracker peer list into the response.</p>
<p>If the peerlist is represented and used as assumed then to improve
randomness in the set of peers handed out by the tracker, it is
RECOMMENDED that the tracker periodically reshuffle the peerlist with
period similar to the rerequest interval.  After each reshuffle the
tracker reperforms the operations described in this section.</p>
<p>To reduce computation the tracker may cache the pseudorandom string
generated by RC4 and reuse it as peers arrive and depart.</p>
<p>The tracker MAY also cache the encrypted tracker peer list.  To
support this the tracker must pass two additional keys <em>i</em> and <em>n</em>
each with integer values.  Decryption starts by XORing from <em>6i</em> bytes
for ipv4 (or <em>18i</em> for ipv6) into the pseudorandom string.  Assuming
that the tracker encrypted the tracker peer list starting from the
first byte in the pseudorandom string then <em>i</em> also corresponds to the
<em>ith</em> ip-port pair in the tracker peer list and the starting point of
the copy into the returned request.</p>
<p>So that the client and the tracker do not have to generate an
arbitrarily long pseudorandom string to support large swarms, we
assume the tracker bounds the length of the pseudorandom string and
reports the length in ip-port pairs as the value to key <em>n</em>.  We
RECOMMEND that <em>n</em> be equal to the length of the tracker peer list or
random but within constant factor of the longest peerlist returned by
the tracker, whichever is smaller.  Thus the tracker encrypts the
<em>jth</em> byte of the <em>ith</em> ip-port pair in an ipv4 tracker peer list by
XORing with the byte <em>(6i+j)</em> <cite>mod</cite> <em>n</em> bytes into the pseudorandom
string.</p>
<p>Since providing <em>i</em> and <em>n</em> significantly reduces the cost for an
attacker to recover the pseudorandom string, the tracker MUST XOR the
value of <em>i</em> with the 32 bits beginning with the 8th least significant
byte of the infohash and <em>n</em> with the least significant 32 bits of the
infohash.  We do not use the first 64 bits of the infohash since the
first 64 bits are used as the RC4 key when not specifying an
initialization vector.</p>
<p>We describe encryption in the following example for an ipv4 tracker peer
list consisting of 3 ip-port pairs, and using an RC4 pseudorandom string
of length <em>n=2</em>. <em>n</em> is small for purposes of illustration.  Also, for the
purpose of illustration, the tracker returns only 3 peers at a time.</p>
<dl class="docutils">

<div class="section" id="rationale">
<h1>rationale</h1>
<p>This extension directly addresses a known attack on the BitTorrent
protocol performed by some deployed network hardware.  By obscuring
the ip-port pairs network hardware can no longer easily identify
ip-port pairs that are running BitTorrent by observing peer-to-tracker
communications.  This deployed hardware under some conditions disrupts
BitTorrent connections by injecting forged TCP reset packets.  Once a
BitTorrent connection has been identified, other attacks could be
performed such as severely rate limiting or blocking these
connections.</p>
<p>This hardware was presumably deployed to get around <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0013.html">BitTorrent
Protocol Encryption</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id6">[2]</a>.  Peers implementing BitTorrent Protocol
Encryption obfuscate peer-to-peer connections by employing RC4
encryption on every byte from the first byte transferred. BitTorrent
Protocol Encryption thus increases the difficulty for a device
observing passing packets to identify BitTorrent peer-to-peer
connections.</p>
<p>By using the SHA-1 of the infohash, the tracker is able to identify
torrents without sending the plaintext infohash and without requiring
an additional prior exchange of a shared secret.  Where trackers now
maintain mappings from infohash to the corresponding torrent's
peerlist and other torrent-specific state, obfuscated trackers would need
one additional mapping from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sha_ih</span></tt> to the torrent's state.
Tracker may also store encrypted versions of each torrent's peer list,
to increase computation performance at the expense of increasing
memory footprint by a constant factor.</p>
<p>The obfuscation method meets the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The entire plaintext of the peer list is not easily obtained
even if an eavesdropper identifies ip-port pairs from
subsequent connections from a peer that has received a tracker response.</li>
<li>Even when a subsequent connection from a peer that has received a
tracker response is observed by an eavesdropper, it is difficult to
map the ip-port pair to specific ciphertext to verify that the
connection is using BitTorrent.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the <a class="reference internal" href="#optimizations">optimizations</a> are used,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Few computations are performed at request time.</li>
<li>Encryption may be performed at the time a peer is added.
The encrypted peer ip and port may be handed out hundreds of times.</li>
<li>Security is minimally impacted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The objective is NOT to create a cryptographically secure protocol
that can survive unlimited observation of passing packets and
substantial computational resources on network timescales.  The object
is to raise the bar sufficiently to deter attacks based on observing
ip-port numbers in peer-to-tracker communications.</p>
<p>If a tracker observes a large number of tracker requests and responses
and subsequent connections, it is possible to attack the encryption.
RC4 is known to have a number of weaknesses especially in the way it
was used with WEP [and HERE].  However, with tracker peer obfuscation, the
number of bytes transferred between the tracker and a client is likely
significantly smaller than transfer between a wireless computer and a
basestation.  An attacker faces a much larger task in obtaining
sufficient probable plaintext to directly break the encryption.</p>
<p>Hobbling the RC4 encryption by using a bounded-length RC4 pseudorandom
string for small swarms is likely to have negilgible impact on
security over any other encyption method since the pseudorandom string
is probably equal to or longer than the plaintext and thus no part of
it is repeated in the XOR except as peers arrive or leave the swarm.
Thus on the timescales of rerequest intervals, nearly the same
ciphertext is handed to every peer requesting the same infohash.
Intercepting the same ciphertext multiple times provides no additional
information to the attacker.  The attacker could correlate ip-port
pairs in connections following tracker responses, but an attacker
could do this regardless of the encryption method employed.
Furthermore more direct methods of traffic analysis applied to
peer-to-peer communication is available to network operators.</p>
<p>For larger swarms, hobbling RC4 may more significantly impact breaking
the encryption since the same pseudorandom string is used repeatedly
across the peer list.  Some study is in order on this point taking
into account that the tracker can periodically change intiailization
vectors.</p>
<p>We know from experience that periodically reshuffling peer lists on
the order of the rerequest interval negligibly impacts tracker
performance even with swarms containing millions of peers.  Generating
a new pseudorandom string using RC4 on this same time interval is
likely to incur negligible performance penalty because 1) RC4 is a
small constant factor more expensive than a shuffle on an input string
of equal length, 2) the generated pseudorandom string is only <em>n</em>
bytes long where recommended <em>n</em> is within a small constant factor
larger than the largest response size and thus much smaller than the
tracker peer list for large swarms, and 3) the cost of the XOR
operation is lighter weight than performing a random shuffle.</p>
