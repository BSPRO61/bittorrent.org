Abstract
========

This extension enables torrents to update based on data stored in the BitTorrent DHT [#BEP-44]_, rather than an HTTP server. The publisher has control over when the torrent is updated, and which content it contains, via mutable DHT items. It is similar to BEP 39 [#BEP-39]_, with the difference being that it uses the DHT to notify and be notified about updates of a torrent, hence should provide more decentralized capabilities to both publishers and consumers.

The intention is to allow publishers to serve content that might change over time in a more decentralized fashion. Consumers interested in publishers content only need to know their public key + optional salt. For instance, entities like Archive.org could publish their database dumps using decentralized mutable torrents, and benefit from not having to maintain a central HTTP feed server to notify consumers about updates.

Rationale
=========

BEP 39 [#BEP-39]_ allows to automatically update torrents based on HTTP URLs. With DHT storing capabilities [#BEP-44]_, we can implement similar functionality in a more decentralized fashion without resorting to central HTTP servers, and using features already present in the BitTorrent network (mainly DHT store).


Publishing content
=========

Publishers should issue a mutable ``put`` request to the DHT when they want to notify consumers about an update of a torrent. The value of the payload ``v`` is the 20 byte infohash of such torrent. Note that there is a 1-to-1 mapping between a mutable item and a torrent, hence a mutable torrent can only ever map to a single torrent.

For request and response details refer to BEP 44 [#BEP-44]_.

Consuming content
========

Consumers issue a ``get`` request using the ID of the mutable torrent they are interested in downloading. Periodically polling such ID by issuing ``get`` requests to see whether the ``v`` property of the response has updated. If an update is found, the torrent can be updated using the new infohash.

Both publisher and consumer should periodically ``put`` the mutable items they have active to keep them alive in the DHT.

Magnet link
===========

``?xt=urn:btpk:[ Public Key (Hex) ]&st=[ Salt ]`` where ``btpk`` contains the hex hash of the public key, and ``st`` the optional raw salt (ex. ``foobar``).
