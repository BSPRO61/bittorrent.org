The BitTorrent Community Forum coordinates the development of the BitTorrent protocol suite and its reference implementation. It is the wish of Bram Cohen that the BitTorrent mainline python implementation remain open source and that the protocol development process be formalized and open to the BitTorrent developer community.  

People willing to perform roles in this organization should
contact the interim editors: David Harrison or Arvid Norberg at 
editor@bittorrent.org. 

Those wishing to submit proposed protocol extensions, read the 
submission_ instructions.

The submission process is modelled after the Python PEP submission process
with some appropriate departures including changing the name used to
refer to proposals to BitTorrent Enhancement Proposals (BEPs).  

For further information see the BEP index_.
