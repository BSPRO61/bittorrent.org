The BitTorrent Community Forum coordinates the development of the BitTorrent protocol suite and its reference implementation. It is the wish of Bram Cohen that the BitTorrent mainline python implementation remain open source and that the protocol development process be formalized and open to the BitTorrent developer community.  

People willing to perform roles in this organization should
contact the interim editors: David Harrison or Arvid Norberg at 
editor@bittorrent.org. 

Those wishing to submit proposed protocol extensions, read the 
submission_instructions_.

The submission process is modelled after the Python PEP submission process.
Every document is assigned a BitTorrent Enhancement Proposal (BEP) number.
This number never changes.  The list of BEPs can be found here_.
